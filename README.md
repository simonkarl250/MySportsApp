# Football Club Search App

## Overview

The Football Club Search App allows users to search for football clubs online using a comprehensive library database. This app was created as part of a challenge project during an interview, where I achieved a 98% skill test score. The app is built using Kotlin and Android Studio, and provides a seamless user experience for football enthusiasts to find information about their favorite clubs.
## Description of the task

You are required to implement an Android application using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
described by the speci;ications below.
You are not allowed to use third-party libraries. The only libraries that you can use are
the standard Android API libraries found in the following URL (with the exception of Views
that you should NOT use):
h"ps://developer.android.com/reference/
It is important to follow exactly the speciGications and your implementation must
conform to these:
The application developed will be helping users to obtain information about football clubs.
The application will be using the h"ps://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php/ Web service and the
Room Library to save information about clubs.
1. When the application starts, it presents the user with 3 buttons labelled Add Leagues to DB,
   Search for Clubs By League and Search for Clubs. (2 marks)
   â€¢
   Clicking on the Add Leagues to DB button saves all the details of a few football leagues
   (from different countries) in an SQLite database which is local to the mobile device
   using the Room library. The speci;ic information of the leagues which will be saved
   is shown in the following link and the information saved could simply be hardcoded
   in the application.
   h"ps://ddracopo.github.io/DOCUM/courses/5cosc023w/football_leagues.txt
   An appropriate database with appropriate tables should be created and populated by your
   application, based on the above data.
